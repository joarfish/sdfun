# Raymarching with Signed Distance Fields - Experiments

![Builds](https://github.com/joarfish/sdfun/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

This little project attempts a couple of things:

- Combine raymarching based rendering with "classical" rendering
- Mirror the raymarching scene on the javascript side to calculate surface positions
- Animate SDFs and add interactivity
